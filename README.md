# Two-Factor Authentication for smart Contracts on Matic Network

We are Digital Bridge https://twitter.com/DigitalBridgeIO
Our main goal is building trust digital bridges for business.

This project consists of re-implementing the "two-factor authenticator" (Google Authenticator) with a Chainlink oracle on Matic Network and other features to improve the latest data on Ethereum.

**This enhancement will increase applicable use cases, due to the benefits of this Layer 2 sidechain scaling solution (key features: scalability, high performance, security)**
