# Two-Factor Authentication for Smart Contracts, using Chainlink oracle on Matic Network

We are Digital Bridge https://twitter.com/DigitalBridgeIO
Our main goal is building trust digital bridges for business.

This project consists of implementing the "two-factor authenticator" (Google Authenticator) for smart contracts with a Chainlink oracle on Matic Network.  There are also others features that improves the previous project that used Ethereum network.

**This enhancement will increase applicable use cases, due to the benefits of this Layer 2 sidechain scaling solution (key features: scalability, high performance, security)**
